## Cryptocurrency/Tech Stock Charting Application

![cryptolytics landing page](https://github.com/dkayucf/Cryptocurrency-Stock-Charting/blob/master/assets/images/landingPage.jpg)

## Project premise: ##
Stock market APIs support publicly-traded stocks, indices,
most mutual funds, ETFs, ETNs and many commodities but have almost no
information on any of what are now 100+ crypto currencies.

In turn the ability to show both traditional mainstream product charts and
crypto-currency charts on the same page represents an innovation.

Fortunately, there are publicly-available APIs & free API keys available from
multiple sources for both types of financial instruments.

The initial free site gives the user the ability to chart any of five (5)
pre-selected publicly-traded technology stocks and fice (5) crypto-currencies.
The user can also select a normalized index of the technology stocks and/or
normalized index of the crypto-currencies.

Future developments will add:

1.  user capability to choose which stocks or crypto currencies,

1.  assign relative weights to whichever combination they may choose.

1.  Chart ratio of two or more items in a single chart to supplemet side-by-side
    comparisons.

1.  Add additional indices such as Baker-Hughes Rig Count, Case-Shiller Home
    Price Indices and perhaps privately-developed indices from the likes Gartner
    Group, Peddie Research or any brokerage or wealth-advisory service.

1.  Add video information specific to the chart items or user-selectable

1.  Add news articles and headlines specific to the charted items or
    user-selectable.

1.  As additional market-driven details become available, the could become a
    tool for charting, and possibly predicting, trends in prices, relative
    prices, demand &/or almost any ratio or relationship users can imagine.

*   Long-term goal is to create a site which can be monetized:

    *   A) users willing to pay a monthly subscription to enable customization.

    *   B) sold to originators, distributors and/or users of chart-able
        information to integrate into their solutions.

    *   C) generates sufficient traffic to attract advertisers.
